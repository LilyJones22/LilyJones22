## About me

I started learning to code because I wanted to be a video game developer<br>
I still do want that of course, but I've been enjoying messing around with other things

I have four cats total. (Technically I have 2 and my fiance has 2)
- Autumn
- Eclipse
- Spook (pictured in my icon)
- Bandit

I enjoy writing stories in my spare time<br>
The Legend of Zelda is my favorite series<br>
Cross stitch is an obsession of mine<br>
Oh, and I've started to get into crochet<br>
